**Hydro Homie Reminder**

A lightweight reminder addon for Frost Mages.

**Overview**

  Hydro Homie Reminder displays a warning box when you are playing Frost, have the Water Elemental talent selected, and your elemental is not currently summoned.
  
  The warning automatically disappears once your Water Elemental is active.
  
  There are no slash commands and no configuration options. The addon is intentionally simple and requires no setup.

**Features**
  Automatically detects Frost specialization
  Checks if the Water Elemental talent is selected
  Does not trigger if Lonely Winter is chosen
  Displays an on-screen warning when the elemental is not active
  Removes the warning immediately once summoned
  Lightweight and passive, no saved variables or menus
**Usage**

Install the addon and play as Frost.

If you have the Water Elemental talent selected and your elemental is not summoned, a warning box will appear. Summon it, and the warning disappears.

That’s all it does.

**Planned Improvements**
  Option to disable warnings in cities
  Combat-only toggle
  Position customization
  Manual enable/disable option

Built to do one thing clearly; make sure your homie is out.
